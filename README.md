Project Overview:
This repository contains the implementation and analysis from my MSc thesis in Cybersecurity at the University of Twente, in collaboration with the University of Padua.
The project investigates machine learning techniques for detecting fake TikTok accounts using a semi-supervised learning framework, adapted from prior research on social platforms.

Key Contributions:
- A Self-Training Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithm (SSSTR)
- Resampling techniques to address class imbalance: SMOTE and CBUTE
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with SVM and Bit-Flip local search for feature selection
- Evaluation using six classifiers and multiple metrics: Accuracy, Recall, F1-Score, G-Mean, and AUC

This research's dataset combines:
A publicly available labeled dataset from GitHub:
- [Fake TikTok Account Detection](https://github.com/raffaele-aurucci/Fake-TikTok-Account-Detection)
- Metadata collected through the TikTok API and the Apify platform

This work investigated model performance and the challenges of applying semi-supervised learning to TikTok fake account detection. 
The results show that factors such as the amount of labeled data, classifier sensitivity to settings, and the quality of feature selection significantly influence outcomes. 
In particular, models trained with limited labeled data or minimal feature sets often showed imbalanced performance, even when resampling techniques were applied. These insights are valuable for developing more reliable fake account detection systems and can guide future research toward improving model robustness under limited supervision.
